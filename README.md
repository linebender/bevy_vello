`bevy_vello` is a cross-platform, 2D compute-centric vector graphics rendering library for Bevy. There is default support for rendering text and scenes, with additional opt-in features for SVG and Lottie. Experimental support for dotLottie is coming.

Quickstart to run the demo:

```shell
cargo run -p demo
```

## Bevy version support

|bevy|bevy_vello|
|---|---|
|0.14|0.5, main|
|0.13|0.1-0.4|
|< 0.13| unsupported |

## Cargo features

> [!WARNING]
> The support of SVG and Lottie is limited. If there is an SVG-related issue, please file the issue in [`vello_svg`](https://github.com/linebender/vello_svg). If there is a Lottie-related issue, please file the issue in [`velato`](https://github.com/linebender/velato). Please see the respective backends for for more information about limitations.

|Cargo feature|Description|Default?|
|---|---|----|
|`default_font`|Include a default font, containing only ASCII characters, at the cost of a 20kB binary size increase|Yes|
|`svg`|Render `.svg` files with [`vello_svg`](https://github.com/linebender/vello_svg)|No|
|`lottie`|Render `.json` Lottie files with [`velato`](https://github.com/linebender/velato)|No|
|`experimental-dotLottie`|Render `.lottie` Lottie files. **Work in Progress**|No|

## Examples

### Cross platform (Bevy)

```shell
cargo run -p <demo name>
```

### Web platform

Because Vello relies heavily on compute shaders, we rely on the emerging WebGPU standard to run on the web.
Until browser support becomes widespread, it will probably be necessary to use development browser versions (e.g. Chrome Canary) and explicitly enable WebGPU.

This uses [`cargo-run-wasm`](https://github.com/rukai/cargo-run-wasm) to build the example for web, and host a local server for it

```shell
# Make sure the Rust toolchain supports the wasm32 target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# The binary name must also be explicitly provided as it differs from the package name
cargo run_wasm -p text
```

There is also a web demo [available here](https://linebender.github.io/bevy_vello) on supporting web browsers.

> [!WARNING]
> The web is not currently a primary target for Vello, and WebGPU implementations are incomplete, so you might run into issues running this example.
