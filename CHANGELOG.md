## [Unreleased]

This release supports Bevy version 0.14 and has an [MSRV][] of 1.80.

### Changed

- bevy_vello now uses Bevy 0.15

## [0.6.1] - 2024-08-14

This release supports Bevy version 0.14 and has an [MSRV][] of 1.80.

### Fixed

- Text is now properly skipped when a `SkipEncoding` component is present. ([#77] by [@simbleau])

## [0.6.0] - 2024-08-09

This release supports Bevy version 0.14 and has an [MSRV][] of 1.80.

### Added

- There is now a `default_font` feature that uses the same `FiraMono-subset.ttf` font used in the bevy/default_font feature.
- There is now a `render_layers` example.
- There is now a `cube_3d` example.
- You may now choose the render layers for the Vello canvas. This can be configured through the `VelloPlugin`.
- You may now choose to use CPU rendering with Vello and configure anti-aliasing. This can be configured through the `VelloPlugin`.
- Added the `SkipEncoding` component, which allows you to skip encoding any renderable asset without removing the asset.

### Changed

- `VelloPlugin` now has configuration. To retain previous behavior, use `VelloPlugin::default()`.
- `VelloRenderer` is now a resource.
- The `VelloRenderer` will attempt CPU fallback if it cannot obtain a GPU.
- The font API has changed significantly. Please visit `examples/text` for further usage. This is to prepare for additional text features such as linebreak behavior, bounded text, and text justification.
  - `VelloText` has been renamed to `VelloTextSection`.
  - `VelloText.content` has been renamed to `VelloText.value`.
  - There is now a `VelloTextStyle` struct and it is a required field of `VelloText`.
  - `VelloFont` has been removed from `VelloTextBundle` and moved into `VelloTextStyle`.
- The field `VelloAssetBundle.vector` was renamed to `VelloAssetBundle.asset`.
- Renamed `VelloAssetAlignment` to `VelloAssetAnchor`. Fields were renamed `alignment` were renamed to `asset_anchor`.
- Renamed `VelloTextAlignment` to `VelloTextAnchor`. Fields were renamed `alignment` were renamed to `text_anchor`.
- The `SSRenderTarget` (fullscreen quad that renders your frame) no longer renders at a zepth of `-0.001`. This was a legacy hack used to ensure Gizmos rendered on-top. `RenderLayers` should be used now (there's an example).

### Removed

- Removed `ZFunction`s from the render pipeline. Now ordering is based solely on the `Transform`'s z component. If you depended on this behavior, you'll need to adjust the transform Z in a system prior to render.
- `VelloRenderPlugin` is now private, as it is not helpful for downstream developers to add manually.
- Removed `VelloCanvasMaterial` from prelude, as it is not typical to use.

### Fixed

- Text, assets, and scenes rendered will now correctly respect camera `RenderLayers`.

## [0.5.1] - 2024-07-04

This release supports Bevy version 0.14 and has an [MSRV][] of 1.79.

### Fixed

- Updated to patch vello 0.2.1. It is now no-longer possible to panic when the vello encodings are empty.
- The demo CI now deploys that bevy_pancam has been updated to bevy 0.14

## [0.5.0] - 2024-07-04

This release supports Bevy version 0.14 and has an [MSRV][] of 1.79.

### Added

- New `scene_ui` example demonstrating a `VelloScene` attached to a `bevy::ui::Node`.

### Changed

- Updated to bevy 0.14
- Updated to vello 0.2
- Updated to velato 0.3
- Updated to vello_svg 0.3

### Fixed

- Removed `Arc` in another `Arc` for `VelloFont`
- Opacity now correctly applies to SVG assets.
- Opacity now applies correctly to the lottie image group, rather than each element and path within it, causing overdraw.
- `VelloScene` components on `bevy::ui::Node` entities now account for Bevy's UI layout systems and render at the expected viewport coordinates

### Removed

- Pancam and/or egui from all examples besides the demo, as external dependencies can bottleneck upgrading to the next bevy version.

## [0.4.2] - 2024-05-26

This release supports Bevy version 0.13 and has an [MSRV][] of 1.78.

### Fixed

- Updated to vello_svg v0.2.0, fixing viewboxes.
- Updates to velato v0.2.0, fixing viewboxes.

## [0.4.1] (Yanked) - 2024-05-26

## [0.4.0] - 2024-05-21

This release supports Bevy version 0.13 and has an [MSRV][] of 1.78.

### Added

- New `svg` example
- New `lottie` example

### Changed

- The GitHub repo has migrated into the linebender org: <https://github.com/linebender>
  - You may need to update your git ref from `loopystudios` to `linebender`
- SVG and Lottie features are now feature-gated
  - SVG (.svg) support is now added through a cargo feature `svg`.
  - Lottie (.json) support is now added through the cargo feature `lottie`.
  - experimental `dotLottie` features (`LottiePlayer`, `PlayerTransition`, `PlayerState`) are now feature-gated through the cargo feature `experimental-dotLottie`. This is only partial support, and a work in progress.
  - `Theme` is now activated through the `lottie` feature, as it was only possible to style runtime lotties.
  - `VelloAsset.metadata()` is no longer available, as it is specific to Lottie. There is now a trait, `LottieExt` that can be imported to call `.metadata()` on a `Composition` instead. This is no longer fallible as a result.
- `PlaybackAlphaOverride` was removed in favor of an `alpha` field on `VelloAsset`.
- `LottiePlayer` was renamed to `DotLottiePlayer`.
- Paths to several locations have changed, e.g. `bevy_vello::assets` -> `bevy_vello::integrations`

### Fixed

- A slow startup delay for lottie assets to begin rendering
- A dotLottie issue where the first frame can jump on web platforms.
